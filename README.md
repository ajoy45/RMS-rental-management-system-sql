# Vehicle Booking Management System (SQL Project)
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a relational database design and SQL querying approach for a Vehicle Booking Management System.
The system manages users, vehicles, and bookings, and provides analytical queries to retrieve meaningful business information such as booking history, availability, and usage statistics.

The primary objective of this project is to practice SQL JOINs, subqueries, aggregation, filtering, and EXISTS/NOT EXISTS logic in a real-world–inspired scenario.
